        <h2>Carissa's Wierd - Songs About Leaving</h2>
        <div class="text"> <p> This is probably my favorite album of all time. <i>Songs About Leaving</i> is a 12 track indie album written by Arizonan band Carissa's Wierd (yes, the I goes before the E). Carissa's Wierd is often classified as a <i>slowcore</i> or <i>sadcore</i> band. Their music is characterized by being very slow (many songs are barely 80 BPM), having downbeat melodies, minimalist melodies, and exceptionally gloomy lyrics. This all comes together to create what, in my opinion, is one of the best listening experiences when one is feeling gloomy and hopeless. The opening track, "You Should be Hated Here" gets right into the core idea of the album. We are introduced to the band's two vocalists - Mat Brooke and Jenn Champion. Carissa's Wierd is typically known for their very quiet, almost inaudible lyrics, but this album is a bit more accessible, and features the loudest vocals out of the band's discography. This song is sad in a somewhat ironic way, and its easy, soft instrumentals provide a comfortable introduction to the album. The next song, "So You Wanna be a Superhero", is possibly the band's most popular song. The vocals are primarily Jenn in this section, and this is one of the most explicitly sad songs lyrically. Jenn's lyrics focus on suicide and depression. It should feel immediately relatable for someone who has been downtrodden for the last couple of months of their life. The instruments are very "indie" feeling - they are somewhat lofi, somewhat amateur sounding. This works to create a "raw", intimate feeling to the song. The vocal performance, which even includes a voice crack, ultimately feels genuine and not cheesy. This song feels homely yet strikingly depressing, and works very well on its own, in LATE NIGHT FEELS playlists. The third track in the album is "September Come Take This Heart Away". This track, with its playtime of nearly 6 and a half minutes, is my personal favorite in the album. It features some of the most violin out of any song in the album, and the lyrics are introspective, depressing, and, at the right time, very relatable. The strong drums over the soft violin and piano melodies creates a washed out and comforting, yet lonely mood. I won't discuss each track in detail, but if you have gotten through these first three tracks without getting bored of the slowness and softness of them, you will probably be able to get through the entire album, and thoroughly enjoy it. This album creates a mood like no other. It discusses depression, suicide, and self-loathing in a better way than any other album I know. It won't fix your problems, but it will make you feel at home while you face them. It might sound boring and uninteresting to many, but this album has been my home during my lowest points, and I've replayed it hundreds of times.
